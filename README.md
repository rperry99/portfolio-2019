# What is this?

This is a personal portfolio project. I have made a few portfolop pages in the past, but my most recent one was from 2018. It was time for me to do another one.

## Technologies Used

I am using this project to practice the following:

- Git Branches
- SASS / SCSS

## Work Log

##### 11/17/19

---

#### 11/18/19

- Add Nav bar and make it responsive
- Change background video to something a little clearer
- Change the width of the CTA button and fixed its animation
- Changed my mind with the navbar. I originally tried to make my own responsive one, but it seemed to break my page. I am going to do a separate project on just creating a responsive nav on my own. For now, bootstrap it is.

#### 11/19/19

- Tried adding Font Awesome by adding the CSS myself but I couldn't get it to work. I am trying [Friconix]() for the first time instead.
- Added footer with social links and make it responsive

#### 11/20/19

- Add contact section
- Followed tutorial on [Bootstrapious](https://bootstrapious.com/p/how-to-build-a-working-bootstrap-contact-form) on how to create a working contact form

---

#### 11/21/19

- Remove PHP and JS for contact form, it won't be much good since this isn't going to be hosted
- Add about me section, and make it responsive
- Add a note that the form does not actually send me an email.
